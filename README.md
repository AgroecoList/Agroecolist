# Agroecolist
AgroecoList is a checklist to improve reporting standards for ecological research in agriculture

## Guidance
1. Collecting all of the variables in AgroEcoList represents a significant body of work for authors, and in many cases authors will not have information for every variable. Missing values (“Not recorded”) are expected, and should be accepted by readers, reviewers and editors. 
2. Some of the variables in the list are more ambiguous (e.g., landscape context) than others (e.g., number of replicates). We have loosely-defined the parameters of some variables as strictly defining them would be too restrictive; we recommend that authors define these variables within the context of their study while also considering the potential contexts within which their study may be reused.
